# IconikCloudFunctions
These are event-driven serverless applications I've written in Python to automate processes inside Iconik.io, a hybrid-cloud asset management system that has a REST API. I run these in Google Cloud as cloud functions. My learning goal this year is to learn Flask and Docker and containerize these.
